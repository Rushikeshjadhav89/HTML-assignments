    <div><b> Football </b>(also known as association football or soccer) is a team sport played between two teams 
        of 11 players each. It is widely considered to be the most popular sport in the world. A ball game, 
        it is played on a rectangular grass field, or occasionally an artificial turf, with a goal at each 
        end of the field. The object of the game is to score by manoeuvring the ball into the opposing goal;
        only the goalkeepers may use their hands or arms to propel the ball in general play. The team that
        scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is tied at the end of the game,
        either a draw is declared or the game goes into extended time, depending on the format of the competition.</div>

        <h4>Nature of the game</h4>
        Football is played in accordance with a set of rules, known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using
         a single round ball (the football) and two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the 
         other team's goal, thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the 
         winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then the game is a draw. There are exceptions to 
         this rule, however; see Duration and tie-breaking methods below.

        The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with 
        their hands or arms during play (though they do use their hands during a throw-in restart). Although players 
        usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their hands or arms.

        <h4>Laws of the Game</h4>
        There are seventeen laws in the official Laws of the Game. The same Laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, 
        although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors or women are permitted. The laws are often framed in 
        broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. In addition to the seventeen 
        laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The laws can be found on the official FIFA website.

        <h4>Major international competitions</h4>
        The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place over a
         four-year period. More than 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental 
         confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, now involves 32 national 
         teams (increased in 1998 from the 24 of 1994) competing over a four-week period. The 2006 FIFA World Cup took place in Germany; in 2010 it will be held in South Africa.
