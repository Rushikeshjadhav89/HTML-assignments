        <h4>Laws and gameplay</h4>
        In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit.
         There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has 
         been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.[63]

    <h4>Playing area</h4>
        <div>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.[64] The field 
            is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the 
            stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[65]
        </div>
        <div>
            In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited 
            at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[66] The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short 
            grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each 
            wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.
