    <h2>SUBTYPES</h2>
    <h4>1. Bandy</h4>
    <div>
        
      <p>  Bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice arena (bandy rink), typically outdoors, and with many rules 
        similar to association football. It is played professionally in Russia and Sweden. The sport is recognized by the IOC; 
        its international governing body is the Federation of International Bandy.</p>
    
      <p> Bandy has its roots in England in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the ice",[14] and spread from England 
        to other European countries around 1900; a similar Russian sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is 
        sometimes called "Russian hockey". Bandy World Championships have been played since 1957 and Women's Bandy World Championships
         since 2004. There are national club championships in many countries and the top clubs in the world play in the Bandy World Cup every year.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>2. Field hockey</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small, hard ball approximately 73 mm 
        (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular among both men and women in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Asia, Australia, New 
        Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina. In most countries, the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.</p> 

        <p> The governing body is the 126-member International Hockey Federation (FIH). Men's field hockey has been played at each Summer Olympic Games
             since 1908 except for 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>3. Ice hockey</h4>
    <div>
        <p>Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc 
            called a puck. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is
             played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world. It is the most popular sport in 
             Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia[17] and the national winter sport 
             of Canada.[18] Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ages.</p>
